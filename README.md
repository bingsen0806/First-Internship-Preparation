# Pre-internship Preparation

So after having a hard time securing my first SE internship at NinjaVan, I wanted to to do some preparation prior to the internship so that I make full use of the 3 months.

During the interview, I asked what I can prepare before the coming internship, and realized that I could possibly prepare for these tech stacks in advance:

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Golang
- TypeScript
- Kafka

This repo documents some of my notes and learning outcomes for the tech stacks above
